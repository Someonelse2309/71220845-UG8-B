I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
You know I got ya

Ain't nobody got you like that
Ain't nobody gonna have your back like the way I do
Love me, just say you do
You know you got me
Everything I do, everything I did
Everything I wished I was will make me feel alright
I'm just saying, so

I really like it
Nothing in the world could make me feel
The way you do, the things you do
I really like it

Your love makes my heart skips struck
Just a little touch, My world stops
Finally, i know that you're mine
I don't wanna fall
Don't wanna play this game of lve, oh-eh-oh
There's no way to hide
